    <div id="beschreibung"><p>I lost my wallet in September. It was important to me. Not because of the look or feel of the 50 euros that were still in there, because these very meaningful little memories were captured. One for each of my family. Because they meant a lot to me, I tried to recreate them and archive them here.</p></div>

    <p> My mother's press card from 2011.
        It always fascinates me that she gets one every year,
        even though she is no longer a member.
        This reminds me that people can be bold in some situations.
